<img src="/home/javi/MEGA/Code/Study/todo-typescript-react-app/public/todo-app.gif" alt="todo-app" style="zoom:50%;" />

The app has the ability to:

- collect strings from the only input field
- convert the strings into "todo" objects
- display the collected "todos" under a "todo list"
- the user can check and uncheck each "todo"
- the user can delete all the checked "todos" at once 
- the app uses custom CSS styling
- the app uses custom checkboxes
